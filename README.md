# Deep Unfolded Robust PCA

This is an implementation of Convolutional rObust pRinipal cOmpoNent Analysis (CORONA) network from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08252) paper done as the part of Explore AI @ NYCU workshop.

In the video_folder there are predictions of small model with three 5x5 ISTA cells.
